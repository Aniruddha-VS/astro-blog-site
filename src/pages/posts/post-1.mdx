On top of everything comes to mind my work trip to Banglore. One and half month stay at a PG. Reality check of how to focus on growth. 

It has got me thinking i need to move faster and not get stagnated. Focus on how to people and connections are important. I dont wanna be isolated. People are necessary. 

How taking actions and giving tit for tat is the only way to handle some problems.

I actually read Chetan Bhagat a lot. My favorite one to read was “One Indian Girl”.

2 nights at the pg in pune. Enjoying with group. Playing cards till 3 in the morning was fun.

1 month of swimming lovely.

Pune in Ganpati Time. Obsession of dagduseth was awsome. Discovering city of Pune. Its bakeries, cafes and ice creams. Still not very comfortable sitting in cafes alone. But it was great.

Now little bit used to travelling but still always awesome.

Gyming was great.

 Favorite places i discovered,

- Waterfall of Ajanta. No network place whose background was so stunning felt like it was from Kashmir or something.
- Vidhan Soudha, Bangalore. The moment you step out lf the metro station outside it you realise how massive the building really is. Could not stop taking pictures.
